# Statamic Docker Containers

Prebuilt docker container, adjusted specifically for common statamic deployment use cases, with control panel.

## Quick Deployment Patterns




## General Disclaimer

In event that an official statamic docker container is released and maintain, it is highly recommended to validate your use case against the official container (instead of this container) as we have no long term plans to maintain this container on a regular basis, or anything beyond our use cases. This is opensourced for refrence for you to either extend or build your own container. YMMV.
